# CD_BotCore

CD BotCore is a Python based modular bot system. It is based off of Commander V1, The same core system used in FangOS v0.1.
It can emulate Python shells through discord using the "load" command, and run standard FangOS Apps and Extensions.

Upon first running the program, BotCore will request which configuration folder it will use for bot.
This can also be provided as a command line argument to avoid repeatedly entering the folder name.

Create a folder that the bot can use, and enter its name.
BotCore will then continue to create the necesarry configuration files needed to run the program.
